You know those days when we have the impression that is different from the others? 
Where do we see our wake, our stretch and yawn on other aspect? 
We look in the mirror, watching our daily movements, the routine of the beginnings of days. 
we always do and when do not pay attention to that almost do not. It is a change, anything out of place leaves us in panic when we are stuck to routine.
You watched it seems go through different places when we simply delayed? Everything changes. 
The sun's color, brightness, movement in the streets, their sounds, the amount of people and the eyes of those who live with us. It's all conditioned world the continuous ticking of a clock. Nothing can change of pace!
Suddenly you raise early and even falling asleep, decides to look for at least one opening to see how the day dawns, as the sun rises and the colors and sounds of those moments. 
The birds celebrate a great pleasure it is to live, wake up and be able to feel this magic. Then you can give more value to your time and the time of life, it never stops.
starts to run. 
People talk, the first horns and roar of engines, traffic ......, it’s time to run, too. Do you feel that your body is leaning against a window, a door or a wall, etc. 
You feel the wind blowing gently, but sometimes cold, his face. On this day the bathwater is strange. You can, for more than mere moments, I felt - her massaging her neck, her face, her hands; the rings and realize its importance. In a relaxation worthy of delay. "Would be another ten minutes here ..."
Her wardrobe is now dull, as often (we never settle!) You look, look, try combining ..... if you have a little patience, will find a blouse ages ago and forgotten .... ah! Or will you be late.
And breakfast? It is almost always the same thing! A must. Some people ranging and many tears. Hunger, unemployment, humiliation, violence. I forgot something?
Oh, damn! For thirty seconds, just missed the bus! Do we still give us as account time is precious? A lot of people know, knows the graceful mystery, or dark, which may represent thirty seconds in traffic, a robbery in a hug, a smile, etc.
We pay attention to what happens to us every second? With the life around us? With the "navel" of next? 
Life is the smiling, but will smile back or are nice to her too? You look in the eyes of the people who pass you on a busy street? He stopped to see the grace in everything that we can take in a day? I can say that only we are not happier because do not pay attention to the miracles of life exploding alltime around us. 
I see a lot of people wasting your time with nonsense, thinking that it is better than others and forgetting to realize happiness in things simpler and more simplistic gestures where money, psychological and social status do not come.

As the day goes on, you will studying, working, finding friends, is boring-and dating, loving .... in the immensity of a day .
Coming home at night. 
in your cozy little place, take off your shoes and massage your feet for a few minutes and think about everything you saw, heard, he said and learned. In all that can be improved for tomorrow give more opportunities and accomplishments. 
Think of all the "good days" that did not, in smiles rejected the concerns and hurry. In the phone call that did not and who did not respond. In person remembered and forgotten on this day. On a visit you need to do. Take a good bath and love your day.
... It appears a picture on the front. Strange colors, distorted figures, voices that do not understand. Sensations that seem to be his. But are. Surely this is the painting of a day that almost goes unnoticed to you like that dream.
Enjoy your day trying to create a masterpiece in his life, a perfect painting, undisputed price for the night having dreams where you can at least see a smile and feel happy.
