You know those days when we have the impression that is different from the others?<br> 
Where do we see our wake, our stretch and yawn on other aspect?<br> 
We look in the mirror, watching our daily movements, the routine of the beginnings of days.<br> 
we always do and when do not pay attention to that almost do not.<br>
It is a change, anything out of place leaves us in panic when we are stuck to routine.<br>
You watched it seems go through different places when we simply delayed? Everything changes.<br> 
The sun's color, brightness, movement in the streets, their sounds, the amount of people and the eyes of those who live with us.<br>
It's all conditioned world the continuous ticking of a clock.<br>
Nothing can change of pace!</br>
Suddenly you raise early and even falling asleep, decides to look for at least one opening to see how the day dawns,<br>
as the sun rises and the colors and sounds of those moments.</br> 
The birds celebrate a great pleasure it is to live, wake up and be able to feel this magic.<br>
Then you can give more value to your time and the time of life, it never stops.<br>
starts to run. <br>
People talk, the first horns and roar of engines, traffic ......,<br>
its time to run, too. Do you feel that your body is leaning against a window, a door or a wall, etc.<br> 
You feel the wind blowing gently, but sometimes cold, his face. On this day the bathwater is strange.<br>
You can, for more than mere moments, I felt - her massaging her neck, her face, her hands; the rings and realize its importance.<br>
In a relaxation worthy of delay. "Would be another ten minutes here ..."<br>
Her wardrobe is now dull, as often (we never settle!) You look, look, try combining .....<br>
if you have a little patience, will find a blouse ages ago and forgotten .... ah! Or will you be late.<br>
And breakfast? It is almost always the same thing! A must.<br>
Some people ranging and many tears.<br>
Hunger, unemployment, humiliation, violence. I forgot something?<br>
Oh, damn! For thirty seconds, just missed the bus! Do we still give us as account time is precious?<br>
A lot of people know, knows the graceful mystery, or dark,<br>
which may represent thirty seconds in traffic, a robbery in a hug, a smile, etc.<br>
We pay attention to what happens to us every second?<br>
With the life around us? With the "navel" of next? <br>
Life is the smiling, but will smile back or are nice to her too?<br>
You look in the eyes of the people who pass you on a busy street?<br>
He stopped to see the grace in everything that we can take in a day?<br>
I can say that only we are not happier because do not pay attention<br>
the miracles of life exploding all time around us.<br> 
I see a lot of people wasting your time with nonsense,<br>
thinking that it is better than others and forgetting to realize happiness<br>
in things simpler and more simplistic gestures where money, psychological and social status do not come.<br>
<br>
As the day goes on, you will studying, working, finding friends, is boring-and dating, loving ....<br>
in the immensity of a day .<br>
Coming home at night.<br> 
in your cozy little place, take off your shoes and massage your feet for a few minutes and<br>
think about everything you saw,<br>
heard, he said and learned.<br>
In all that can be improved for tomorrow give more opportunities and accomplishments.<br>
<br> 
Think of all the "good days" that did not, in smiles rejected the concerns and hurry.<br>
In the phone call that did not and who did not respond.<br>
In person remembered and forgotten on this day.<br>
On a visit you need to do. Take a good bath and love your day.<br>
... It appears a picture on the front.<br>
Strange colors, distorted figures, voices that do not understand.<br>
Sensations that seem to be his. But are.<br>
Surely this is the painting of a day that almost goes unnoticed to you like that dream.<br>
Enjoy your day trying to create a masterpiece in his life, a perfect painting,<br>
undisputed price for the night having dreams where you can at least see a smile and feel happy.<br>
