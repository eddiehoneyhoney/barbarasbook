Hello, tell me what you can do?<br>
Where can you go?<br>
Where do you come from?<br>
What is your planet?<br>
<br>
You can read my thoughts?<br>
Strange, because I can read yours.<br>
And I can see the brightness and colour his aura.<br>
I can feel what you feel.<br>
<br>
human Super, what's your colour?<br> 
have you ever managed to see in mirror<br>
Strange,because I can not see myself.<br>
There is always someone making me.<br>
<br>
human Super, his face changes every week.<br>
You make a new wound every day.<br>
What the point of all?<br>
do you remember you're getting at?<br>
<br>
Superhuman, her face is beautiful.<br>
You say shocking things.<br>
all intimidated by you.<br>
All I ever dared be.<br>
<br>
who did your food today?<br>
what is your superego the next few minutes?<br>
how's your super mind?<br>
I hear you flow ...<br>
<br>
Read my thoughts, please!<br>
tell me what colour should I take as principle today.<br>
tell me what words should I use ...<br>
what should I feel?<br>
<br>
Super human, I know your name.<br>
half human, half machine.<br>
But you bleed and cry and smile and eat and sleep and love wine.<br>
what is the size of your soul?<br>
<br>
how many universes you've gotten inside your soul?<br>
Can read my mind and feel what I feel?<br>
it touches my hand and feel my smell.<br>
Super human ... your skin feels cold, but heats up fast.<br>
<br>
the wind blows my face, now .<br>
the melody is like starlight. <br>
I can no longer shiver me.<br>
But I can describe my wishes in my thoughts.<br>
<br>
they are like her by touching me.<br>
they are like the faith that makes me smile.<br>
they are like a superhuman who can proceed.<br>
